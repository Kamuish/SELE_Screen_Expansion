Functionalities to show:
    
    - Talk about the communication protocols and the limitations imposed by the backpack
        - SPI (lack of) error handling
        - I2C error handling
        - Show the protocols working as expected
        - Show error on the I2C protocol

    - Display the algorithm working as expected (all memory tests passing)

    - Talk about the memory tests:
        - brief overview of FLASH, EEPROM and SRAM memory tests
        - Talk about how we calculate the hash from the hex file and how we send it
        - Talk about the EEPROM memory test 
        - Talk about the SRAM MARCH C test

        - Simulate detection of faults:

            - SRAM and EEPROM : simply set the error variables to one
            - FLASH : change a line of code and compile it

    - Talk about the NASA coding standards and what we did not implement

    - Show the schematic of the circuit


What we should prepare better:
    
    - Defend our choice of the MARCH C memory test
    - Problems in the EEMEM
